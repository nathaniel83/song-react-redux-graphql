* Clear means your document uses simple, generally accepted and unambiguous words and sentences to describe the key point. You should never try to make the document more complicated by using some confusing words and ambiguous instructions in the text. You can only use special terms and definitions if the project really requires that (e.g. in an engineering project it may be required to write about some technical terms and math calculations). However, it is best to avoid using special terms and definitions in project descriptions.
* Concise means the project description actually “describes the project”, with no reference to other projects or not related information. You should never mention about something that is directly linked to your project and its context. Otherwise you’re likely to will confuse the reader or keep the reader unfocused on the key points of your project.
* Complete means that your description includes everything that concerns and deals with the project. Although you must keep the document concise (as I said above) there is the need to make sure the text is 100% complete for the intended audience. You must be sure that the document covers every critical aspect that is required for the reader to understand and comprehend the project and its context.
* Credible means in your project description document you refer to up-to-date and relevant information only. You should never use data that is not related to the matter or does not support the idea of your project.
