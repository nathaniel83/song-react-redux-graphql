My algorithms to fix the interviewing questions, written in Javascript(ES6).

## Motivation
As a programmer, algorithm lies behind the solutions and should be practiced for sure, especially for a backend developer. While I used to focus on front end world more, but I still found it a necessity at the time around 2017 March, when I was focusing on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and found it hard to contribute without neat codes. And so I started the practicing journey.

## Platforms
### Exercism 
I started here cause I found it working with the command line, which suits me pretty well since I was a terminal freak. Also, the questions and testing tools were in the place I could see makes it fun to try. It was a good place to start, but I still moved pass it cause the community there wasn’t the best. 
### Codewars
The second place I practiced on is [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), even that was not the first place in my mind. But after a little research, I found it an excellent place to play with since they got online testing and probably the best Javascript algorithm community. It was a kind of enlightenment, and I learn a lot from other programmers’ codes. After finishing [125 questions](https://www.codewars.com/users/wangsup), I ended up my journey with top 4% ranking, I didn’t know it was that high, but I did stagnant for a while for the difficulty up there was a little bit crazy to me. Also, the test cases there was not that good; Sometimes, I need to write my test cases with the chosen test engine(Jasmine I guess), that was a piece of experience, but I did like it, I am more of a single threaded person and wanted to focus on the algorithm.

### Leetcode
Leetcode must be the most serious and well-known algorithm practicing website I have ever seen. You can not believe how popular this website is in my Chinese fellows’ world. And it deserves it: the community there was everything about better algorithms and real world interview questions. Although the people were a little bit too focused on Java and Cpp (for the best practice of finding a job for sure), the people there are unbelievable, and I had some really good [practices](https://leetcode.com/wangsup/) there.
