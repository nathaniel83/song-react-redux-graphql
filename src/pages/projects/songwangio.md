The website about Song Wang.

## Motivation
to be written

## Sections
### Projects
I added the portfolio the last into my website; even it could be the most important one for me to get hired. But it comes with a benefit that I could be much more comfortable building it since I am much more familiar and comfortable with the layout(trust me I quit many times when I was not comfortable with the things I built). 

Not surprisingly, I finished it fast and neat, aligned with the rest of the sections. It was not a lot of work since I had most of the styling components built(thanks to Styled Component) in my theme. 

### Blogs
Blog was one of the first thing I care about when I started building websites. As many other programmers, I have moments wanting to put the ideas and thinkings into words and let the world be known. 

I gave a few try on another static website generator Jekyll before, and I liked them a lot, but since React came in, I couldn’t resist writing modular components and styles in Javascript and quit it.  I like my decision cause by looking back to the Jekyll project’s source codes, I can honestly my current codes are cleaner, leaner, and most of all, more modular  and reusable. 

### Notes
I started this section after seeing this guy’s [TIL](http://ricostacruz.com/til/) site. It’s pretty neat to have a list to show a few of line of things without dive into a blog, not only logging the commands and small procedures on a specific tech fields for later reviewing, but share some of the pain efforts and save others programmers some times if possible. Also, I wrote a bunch of words for myself and myself only, I can just leave it there and search it later, tracking my minds. It’s always nice to memorizes thing somewhere for later. 

### External links
It’s a trivial thing comparing to others, I was thinking about keeping one awesome link a time with a name for later referencing, yet only find myself not a reviewing kinda guy. I might just commented it out from the frontend and just save the data.
