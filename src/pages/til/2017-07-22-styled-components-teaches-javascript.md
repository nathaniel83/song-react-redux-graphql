I took a look at this [tutorial](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/blob/master/docs/tips-and-tricks.md) of styled components. Apparently, it uses javascript extensively, and teaches me something of javascript like `object.keys`, `objects.assign`. That's one way to learn javascript I guess.â€‹
